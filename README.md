# Next Mobile Demo UI

This is a demo of the Next UI for mobile devices. The concept for the Next App was created by Team Next at the [2024 Code Hack](https://www.islandhealth.ca/about-us/accountability/innovation/code-hack). The Next App is intended to improve the patient's experience in an emergency unit. The main features are an estimated wait time, patient status, and a feature that allows the user to escalate issues to staff.
